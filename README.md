# Capy Trading Bot

This repository contains simple DeFi bots in Typescript, which are designed to find and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in different SUI DEXs and/or perform trading activities based on script-logic strategies. Since it is still in BETA version, the agents might not be profitable and are mainly open-sourced as a reference implementation that could be reused to implement custom strategies.

## Features

- Implements a basic `Strategy` interface (developers can implement their own strategies).
- Provides three basic trading strategies as reference implementations (described later in this Readme).
- Automatically executes trades when it finds profitable opportunities.
- Supports multiple cryptocurrencies and trading pairs; currently supporting trading on three Sui DEXs.
- Supports receiving data from multiple sources, including swap pools and external sources like Binance. Currently, the bot utilizes feeds from [CCTX (CryptoCurrency eXchange Trading Library)](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) to get the latest prices from Binance. Note that CCTX supports Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin and OKX, and it is straight-forward to accept feeds from these CEXs as well.

## Overview

In Capy Trading Bot, **strategies** subscribe to relevant **data sources** and create **trade orders** based on the information they get. Every second, Capy Trading Bot requests new data points from each data source. When it receives a new data point, Capy Trading Bot sends it to subscribing strategies which return trade orders to Capy Trading Bot. Capy Trading Bot submits transactions to the relevant swap pools modules to execute these trade orders. If a strategy returns multiple trade orders, Capy Trading Bot submits them as a single transaction.

## Strategies

Capy Trading Bot supports the following three trading strategies:
- `Arbitrage`: This strategy looks for [arbitrage opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_arbitrage) in chains of two or more swap pools across different DEXs. It computes the product of the prices along the chain of swap pools, say SUI -> USDC -> CETUS -> SUI, and if the product is different from 1 it means there is an arbitrage opportunity.
- `RideTheTrend`: This strategy looks for [trend following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following) opportunities in a single swap pool by comparing a short moving average with a longer moving average to get an indication whether the price is going up or down.
- `MarketDifference`: This strategy compares the relative price of a token pair in a swap pool with the price of the same pair on an exchange, such as Binance. If the price differs, the strategy suggests to either go long or short a given token.

Strategies are located in the `src/strategies` folder, and each strategy extends the `Strategy` class which requires the
`evaluate` method to be implemented. The `evaluate` method is called every second with the latest data point from the
data sources and should return a (potentially empty) array of trade orders.

To add other strategies, you can implement them as described above and add it to Capy Trading Bot by calling `capybot.addStrategy` in `src/index.ts`.

## Data sources

Capy Trading Bot can leverage two different types of data sources: Swap pools and external sources. Capy Trading Bot can execute trades via swap pools, and swap pools provide the current token price in the pool. External data sources can provide additional data that could be useful inputs to trading strategies.

In this release, Capy Trading Bot supports swap pools from [Cetus](https://www.cetus.zone/), [Turbos](https://turbos.finance/) and
[Suiswap](https://suiswap.app/app/), and uses Binance (via [CCTX](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt)) as an external data source for the relative prices of some token pairs.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Usage

Export the `ADMIN_PHRASE` and the `ADMIN_ADDRESS`:

```shell
export ADMIN_PHRASE=""
export ADMIN_ADDRESS="0x..."
```

1. Build the project with `npm run build`
2. Run the script with `npm run start`

This will run the bot for one hour. To run the bot for longer you should change the `duration` value in the call to `capybot.loop` in `src/index.ts`.

## Monitoring

The Capybot Monitor is a collection of Python scripts to monitor the status of a running instance of a Capybot. It produces live updated plots like the following which shows the price development for the swap pools the given Capybot was trading where 1 is the price when the bot was started.
